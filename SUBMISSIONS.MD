# Code Submission Guide 🚀

Welcome to our coding challenges! We're excited to see your solutions. Here's a step-by-step guide to make your code submission process smooth and enjoyable.

## 📝 Instructions

### 1. **Fork the Repository**

Begin by forking the main repository to your GitHub account. This will create a personal copy of the repository that you can work with.

### 2. **Sync and Update**

If you see `few commits behind` Just navigate to your forked repository, and hit the **"Sync Fork"** button to fetch the latest changes. Then, click **"Update Branch"** to ensure your fork is up-to-date.

### 3. **Navigate to the Right Day**

Browse through the repository and find the folder corresponding to the day you're submitting for.

### 4. **Add and Upload**

Click on "Add file" and select "Upload File." Now, proudly upload your notebook, naming it like a pro – perhaps something like `YourName_DayX.ipynb`.

### 5. **Commit with a Smile**

Let's capture the moment! Craft a meaningful commit message that reflects your achievement, like "Conquering Day X – YourName." After that, hit "Commit Changes."

### 6. **Stay Ahead**

Return to your repository's main page and look for the "Commits ahead" indicator. Click on it to see your progress.

### 7. **Unleash the PR Beast**

Now, it's showtime! Click on "Create Pull Request." Let your work be seen by the world.

### 8. **Seal the Deal**

You're almost there! On the next page, proudly click "Create Pull Request" once again to seal your submission.
